# Vehicle Service

## Note
The `vehicle-service` is a Java-based Spring Boot application that provides an API to retrieve vehicle details based on the vehicle registration number. Currently, I have only implemented the GET method to retrieve vehicle data; the PUT, DELETE, and POST (add) methods have not been added. Additionally, the API is currently public for demonstration purposes. However, in a real-world scenario, it should be securedâ€”this can be achieved by implementing OAuth 2.0, using a service key for service-to-service communication, or other appropriate authentication mechanisms.For demonstration purposes, the service uses hardcoded mock data instead of a real database. In a actual project, this should be replaced with a proper database and repository layer to handle persistent data storage and retrieval.

## Features
